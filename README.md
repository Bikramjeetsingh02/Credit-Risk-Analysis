Credit Risk Analysis

In this project I have compared two approaches to predict Loan Applications using:
1. Advanced Neural network
2. Hybrid machine learning algorithm

In ANN we've used N-fold algorithm where "N" will define the ratio for testing and training.

For hybrid we've used k-means clustering and for classifier we've used "Random Forest" which makes use of decision trees to classify and predict data.
